# EONET Events Viewer

This is a demo project using [EONET API](https://eonet.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/v3) to play with features of .NET, React, etc.

## How to run

‚¨áÔ∏è Get the repo locally.

üöÄ Run [start.cmd](/start.cmd) on Windows.

ü¶Ñ It has the same effect as running [EonetViewer](backend\EonetViewer\EonetViewer.sln) .NET solution from Visual Studio.

‚ö†Ô∏è On the first run, restoring of **NuGet** and **npm** packages could take a few minutes.

üîó A home page opens in browser automatically once things are ready.
